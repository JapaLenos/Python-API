Map something personal. Map data from your own life—this could be places you’ve traveled, your daily routine, or any other personal touch. 🗒️   
Check out this ArcGIS Pro Toolbox, which scans the EXIF data (metadata) of photos on your phone and generates a heatmap showing where the photos were taken. This tool is an improvement over the standard [geotagged photos to points](https://pro.arcgis.com/fr/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/geotagged-photos-to-points.htm) tool because it can handle datasets that contain photos without EXIF location data, processing them without crashing.
